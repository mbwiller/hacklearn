# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for development and maintenance tasks.

## Historical Scripts

Previously, this directory contained harmonization scripts that were used for UI/UX standardization:
- `harmonize-modules.sh` - Initial module harmonization
- `harmonize-batch2.sh` through `harmonize-batch5.sh` - Batch processing scripts

These scripts have been removed as they were one-time operations completed on 2025-10-28. All styling changes have been permanently applied to the source code.

## Future Scripts

This directory is available for future utility scripts such as:
- Build automation
- Content generation helpers
- Test data generators
- Development utilities
