## Technical Concepts

### TCP/UDP Scanning Techniques

**SYN Scan (Half-Open Scan)**
- Mechanism: Sends SYN packet, analyzes SYN-ACK response, never completes handshake
- Advantages: Stealthy (doesn't complete connection), fast, accurate
- Detection: Most IDS detect SYN scans
- Nmap flag: `-sS`

**TCP Connect Scan**
- Mechanism: Completes full three-way handshake
- Advantages: Works without root privileges, bypasses some stateful firewalls
- Detection: Fully logged in application logs
- Nmap flag: `-sT`

**ACK Scan (Firewall Detection)**
- Mechanism: Sends ACK packets to determine firewall rule sets
- Advantages: Maps firewall rules, distinguishes filtered from unfiltered ports
- Nmap flag: `-sA`

**FIN/NULL/XMAS Scans (Stealth Scans)**
- Mechanism: Sends packets with unusual flag combinations
- FIN: FIN flag set
- NULL: No flags set
- XMAS: FIN, PSH, URG flags set
- Advantages: Bypasses some non-stateful firewalls
- Nmap flags: `-sF`, `-sN`, `-sX`

**UDP Scan**
- Mechanism: Sends UDP packets to ports, interprets ICMP unreachable messages
- Advantages: Discovers UDP services (DNS, SNMP, DHCP)
- Disadvantages: Slow, unreliable (ICMP rate limiting)
- Nmap flag: `-sU`

**Idle Scan (Zombie Scan)**
- Mechanism: Uses third-party "zombie" host to scan target without revealing attacker IP
- Advantages: Complete anonymity
- Nmap flag: `-sI <zombie_host>`

### OS Fingerprinting

**TCP/IP Stack Fingerprinting:**
- Initial Window Size variations
- TTL values (Linux: 64, Windows: 128, Cisco: 255)
- TCP options (MSS, Window scaling, SACK)
- IP ID sequencing patterns
- ICMP response characteristics

**Application Layer Fingerprinting:**
- HTTP server headers (Apache, nginx, IIS)
- SSH version strings
- SMB protocol dialects
- SNMP system descriptions

### Enumeration Protocols

- Tools: enum4linux, SMBclient, rpcclient, CrackMapExec
- Vulnerabilities: SMBv1 (EternalBlue CVE-2017-0144), null sessions

**LDAP (TCP 389, 636 SSL)**

- Data Extracted: Network device configurations, routing tables, ARP caches, running processes, installed software
- Community Strings: Default "public" (read) and "private" (write)
- Tools: SNMPwalk, Onesixtyone, snmp-check
- Vulnerabilities: SNMPv1/v2c lack encryption

**DNS Zone Transfer (TCP 53)**
- Mechanism: AXFR request to transfer entire zone file
- Data Extracted: All subdomains, IP addresses, internal hostnames
- Tools: dig, nslookup, fierce, dnsrecon

- Data Extracted: Exported file systems, access permissions, mounted shares on Unix/Linux
- Tools: showmount, nfsshell, nmap NSE scripts

### IDS/IPS Evasion Techniques

**Packet Fragmentation**
- Mechanism: Split scan packets into tiny fragments to bypass signature detection
- Nmap flag: `-f`

**Timing Manipulation**
- Mechanism: Slow scan rates to avoid threshold-based detection
- Nmap flags: `-T0` to `-T5`

**Decoy Scanning**
- Mechanism: Generate scan traffic from multiple spoofed IP addresses
- Nmap flag: `-D <decoy1>,<decoy2>,ME`
